## Next steps

1. New project created with typescript create-react-app, customize the default app a little.
   1. Check out create-react-apps vulnerabilities
   2. Check out Reacts debugging and hot reload
2. Build a Github pipeline, so that when building the production build it is uploaded to S3 bucket and Cloudfront invalidates cache (and automatically gets the latest from S3)
